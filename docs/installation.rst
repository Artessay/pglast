 Installation
==============

As usual, the easiest way is with pip::

  $ pip install pglast

Alternatively you can clone the repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/lelit/pglast.git --recursive

and install from there::

  $ pip install ./pglast

Development
-----------

There is a set of *makefiles* implementing the most common operations, a ``make help`` will
show a brief table of contents. A comprehensive test suite, based on pytest__, covers 99% of
the source lines.
